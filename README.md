# Udacity-Cpp-Nanodegree-Repo

Repository of Udacity C++ Nanodegree projects. 
Sharing while learning 😁.

This program first walk through Object-Oriented Programming and then gets you exposed to Modern C++ features.

## Build Instructions

See the build instructions in each project folder.

## [Project 1 - Route Planning](https://github.com/ArincDemirel/Udacity-Cpp-Nanodegree-Repo/tree/main/Project1_Route_Planning)

> In this project, a route planner between two points on real map data is created. The optimal path between the starting point and the ending point can be found by implementing  `A*` search algorithm.

## [Project 2 - System Monitor](https://github.com/ArincDemirel/Udacity-Cpp-Nanodegree-Repo/tree/main/Project2_System_Monitor)

> In this project, a system monitor is created which resembles the program htop, which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems applications.

## [Project 3 - Memory Management ChatBot](https://github.com/ArincDemirel/Udacity-Cpp-Nanodegree-Repo/tree/main/Project3_Memory_Management_Chatbot)

> In this project, we optimize a ChatBot program with modern C++ memory management methods(e.g. smart pointer, move semantics)

## [Project 4 - Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/ArincDemirel/Udacity-Cpp-Nanodegree-Repo/tree/main/Project4_Concurrent_Traffic_Simulation)

> In this project, we create a multithreaded trafic simulator(vehicle, streets, itersections and traffic lights) using a real map of a urban space. Each vehicle has it's own thread and itersections are managed to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.
